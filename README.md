# Image-Captioning
Image captioning is the task of generating descriptions for an image automatically and reduce human efforts in the task of captioning. It plays an important role in multiple tasks such as generating multiple captions for unlabelled textbook images, providing descriptive summary to blind people, etc.

Not only the summary should tell about the objects present in the image and the relation between them but also the description should be fluent and coherent in a human understandable context and that is what makes the task of image captioning difficult.

#Problem Statement
We will try to analyze the problem of image captioning from the vision and natural language aspect. For the vision part of the problem, we will focus on majorly two problems: feature extraction and object recognition. This will form the basis of the our analysis further. We will try to use different architectures for this problem. Some of them include CNN+RNN, CNN+Transformers and other techniques. This forms the basis of the natural language part of the problem. Using the results generated, we will perform caption generation task using various methods such as LSTM, encoder-decoders and other techniques.
